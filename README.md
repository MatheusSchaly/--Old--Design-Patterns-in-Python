# Design-Patterns-in-Python

Here you will find a brief # explaination # of the 23 design patterns, as well as their # UML # representation and # Python code #.
I'm only a student, so don't rely too much on the this repository. I also appreciate any suggestions.

My main references were:
1. Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (very good)
2. Wikipedia.org
3. Sourcemaking.com
4. Youtube.com - Derek Banas
5. Tutorialspoint.com
6. Geeksforgeeks.org
7. Learning Python Design Patterns - Second Edition (not that good)
